Majestic creatures of the field,
Grazing peacefully, never to yield.
Their gentle moo echoes far and wide,
With soft brown eyes, their presence dignified.

Black and white, or brown and cream,
They roam and ruminate, a pastoral dream.
A symbol of strength, sustenance, and peace,
A source of comfort, a release.

For farmers, they are a livelihood,
A way of life, of toil, and love.
They care for them, with utmost pride,
Their cows, their partners, by their side.

So here's to these gentle beasts of the land,
Their beauty, grace, and spirit so grand.
May they roam free, forever blessed,
Our bovine friends, a true success.
